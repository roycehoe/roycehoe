👋Hi, I’m @roycehoe

 - 🗣️Telling people about the apps I have built

What I enjoy about programming

 - 📖Reading good code. I love reading code so logical, so succinct, so clean, so well organized, it transcends into beautifully written prose. 
 - ✒️Writing good code, and the journey of striving to write cleaner and cleaner code.
 - ☁️Dreaming solutions, building them, watching them work, and feeling good. I speak for most programmers when I say this. The feeling of making stuff work is why all of us fell in love with programming in the first place.
